### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRaL-8qZ0mM&) - This was a thorough breakdown that often helped me really understand how certain flexbox items were moving and position on the web. I really liked this style of teaching from Kevin Powell.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlJw4YZAzjg&t=3793s) - Although this was just the homepage, this tutorial is one that I truly recommend to anyone trying to create a fully responsive webpage. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning CSS and HTML.
